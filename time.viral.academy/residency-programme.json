Software can make this barter easier.","type":"paragraph"},{"id":"bf5d09686a2104fa","text":"The second more experimental arrangement, is when someone from the outside comes to stay for free at one of the [[Residency Spaces]]. Some spaces have spare rooms, or spare capacity. The deal here is that in return for getting a free place to stay you need to contribute a number of hours to an open source, or [[Free Culture]] project. You need to give back to the community.","type":"paragraph"},{"id":"024a963909fd0c50","text":"<H3>A Reciprocal Deal","type":"html"},{"id":"a5eed42d2186e731","text":"There are two parties to any barter.
