Rather than go down the rabbit hole on natural disasters, I was thinking of the way that pressure works to extract the resource. Unlike mining which used to be a slow process of chipping away the earth to get to the goods, fracking involves machinery--dare I say technology--to get to the resource faster. More efficiently, so it's told. It's the idea of efficiency and speed that I was working on, but perhaps I just created a lame title.
