This archive will be used to inform both the final performance, and the design of the open source software created by the project.\n\nBorrowing from the methods developed by the Occupy movement, by architects and the ‚Äúlegislative theatre‚Äù of Augusto Boal we will design and build not only the physical representation of utopia in Minecraft, but also the economic, social and political rules of the society.\n\nThis ‚Äúlegislation‚Äù will be recorded with the poplus.org software used by real parliaments around the world, and then encoded as cryptographic digital contracts, that utilise a serverless p2p architecture facilitated by the radical and pioneering ethereum.org project.\n\nThe project culminates with a 72 hour performance, in which the community will build utopia block-by-block in Minecraft, accompanied by live spoken word pieces curated from a global community. The build will be filmed using high definition time-lapse cinematography, streamed and remixed live on www.utopia.fm.\n\nUtopia is a unique work of art, in which community, spoken word, and software build to create a live performance, a multiplayer game, and a radical legal form, that captures the fears and aspirations of its participants, encoded on the block chain and owned by (no one and) everyone.","type":"map"},"type":"edit"},{"date":1423394845395,"id":"d268ff6a635a7f11","item":{"id":"d268ff6a635a7f11","latlng":{"lat":40.735383,"lng":-73.984655},"text":"","type":"map","zoom":13},"type":"edit"},{"after":"d268ff6a635a7f11","date":1423394880452,"id":"927f820ec10176b4","item":{"id":"927f820ec10176b4","type":"factory"},"type":"add"},{"date":1423394901816,"id":"927f820ec10176b4","type":"remove"},{"after":"d268ff6a635a7f11","date":1423395018761,"id":"a80e687c6555e293","item":{"id":"a80e687c6555e293","type":"factory"},"type":"add"},{"date":1423395027276,"id":"a80e687c6555e293","item":{"id":"a80e687c6555e293","text":"[[Trash]]","type":"paragraph"},"type":"edit"},{"date":1423395048244,"id":"d268ff6a635a7f11","item":{"id":"d268ff6a635a7f11","latlng":{"lat":40.74036395493162,"lng":-74.0375518798828},"text":"Map Caption ok","type":"map","zoom":13},"type":"edit"},{"date":1423395062280,"id":"d268ff6a635a7f11","type":"remove"},{"after":"a80e687c6555e293","date":1423395081216,"id":"dc7102a8b1e94e24","item":{"id":"dc7102a8b1e94e24","type":"factory"},"type":"add"},{"date":1423395150088,"id":"dc7102a8b1e94e24","type":"remove"},{"after":"a80e687c6555e293","date":1423395162905,"id":"d4c281a8af903bc8","item":{"id":"d4c281a8af903bc8","type":"factory"},"type":"add"},{"after":"a80e687c6555e293","date":1423420913127,"id":"659fb423cf71c877","item":{"id":"659fb423cf71c877","type":"factory"},"type":"add"},{"date":1423421089186,"id":"659fb423cf71c877","item":{"id":"659fb423cf71c877","text":"To celebrate the [[500 Year Anniversary]] of the publication of [[Utopia]], and to accompany the exhibition of the original manuscripts by the [[Museum of Leuven]], we are seeking to curate the publication of a series of live online performances, to take part in three dimensional world of [[Minecraft]].\n\nIn this project we will reconstruct the mythical [[Island of Utopia]], through a [[Participatory Design]] process working with [[Schools, communities and experts]] from around the world. \n\nThese workshops will take place over a 6 month period, and will be documented in video to create an ongoing [[Open Culture Archive]].
