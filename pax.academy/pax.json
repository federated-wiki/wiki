This means that all human collectives and corporate entities WITHOUT EXCEPTION must not claim ownership or control over another. In other words, there must always be an \u0022unsubscribe button\u0022, and this applies to orderies like Pax, but also to individual action. Certain actions are involuntary by definition- theft, murder, rape, fraud etc. Behaving under one of these categories logically means the victim is forced to participate.","type":"paragraph"},"type":"add"},{"date":1423425316430,"id":"5929f3c33898adb4","item":{"id":"5929f3c33898adb4","text":"The etymology of Pax is derived from the Latin for peace and is also the name of the Roman goddess of peace","type":"paragraph"},"type":"edit"},{"date":1423425325097,"id":"5929f3c33898adb4","item":{"id":"5929f3c33898adb4","text":"The etymology of Pax is derived from the Latin for peace and is also the name of the Roman goddess of peace.
