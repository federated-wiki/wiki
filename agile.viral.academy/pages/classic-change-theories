Lewin was the first to develop the notion that\nchange should be planned rather than allowing\nunintentional or accidental processes to occur,\nand he first described three levels of change: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing (Lewin, 1951).\nThis classic theory still guides many planned\norganizational processes with great success.

Another important theory for planning change\nto organizational processes and culture that result\nfrom the design and construction of a new\nbuilding is Ajzen‚Äôs theory of reasoned action and\nplanned behavior (Ajzen, 1991, 2002). This theory\nproposes that the rate of change acceptance and\nadoption is related to an individual‚Äôs perception of\nbeing engaged in the process and the sense of internal\nand external control over the opportunities,\nresources, and skills needed for the change.

Not all change is successful,\nand Kotter is most noted for a classic article in\nthe Harvard Business Review that describes why\nchange efforts often fail (Kotter, 1995). Kotter\nprovides words of wisdom to prevent the negative\nattitudes and the poor adoption of change\ndescribed earlier in this article. Kotter indicates\nthe necessity of (1) creating a sense of urgency\nabout a project; (2) forming a powerful coalition\nto guide the process (change champions and\nleaders); (3) developing a compelling vision and\nguiding principles to guide the design and organizational\nchange process; (4) communicating\nthe vision throughout the entire organization; (5)\nengaging and empowering individuals to act on\ndecisions that support the vision; (6) measuring\nand celebrating short-term wins that sustain the\ngains (milestone charts, e-mail blasts, other visual\nindicators); (7) consolidating improvements\nthat support the vision (changing processes, policies,\nbeliefs, behaviors, and operations); and (8)\ncommunicating and integrating the connections\namong the new behaviors, processes, and structure\nto the overall success of the organization, to\npatient care, and to enhanced work environments\nfor healthcare professionals.
