While centralisation, especially in the governmental sphere, is widely studied and practiced, there is no common definition or understanding of decentralisation. The meaning of decentralization may vary in part because of the different ways it is applied. Concepts of decentralisation have been applied to group dynamics and management science in private businesses and organisations, political science, law and public administration, economics and technology.","type":"paragraph"},"type":"edit"},{"date":1423587709553,"id":"2031b1244de9366d","order":["531ba568698b8728","7296231ab6f837f8","2031b1244de9366d"],"type":"move"},{"date":1423587712121,"id":"531ba568698b8728","order":["7296231ab6f837f8","2031b1244de9366d","531ba568698b8728"],"type":"move"},{"date":1423587716068,"id":"531ba568698b8728","order":["7296231ab6f837f8","531ba568698b8728","2031b1244de9366d"],"type":"move"},{"after":"2031b1244de9366d","date":1423587730997,"id":"d4ad47d2672cb11a","item":{"id":"d4ad47d2672cb11a","type":"factory"},"type":"add"},{"date":1423587749552,"id":"7296231ab6f837f8","item":{"id":"7296231ab6f837f8","text":"Decentralisation is the process of redistributing or dispersing functions, powers, people or things away from a central location or authority.
